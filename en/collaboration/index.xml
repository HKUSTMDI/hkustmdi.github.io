      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;With the development of AI technology, especially in the medical field, machine learning and deep learning technologies have provided new possibilities for pathology diagnosis and research. The collaboration between the laboratory and Guangzhou Anbiping Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (referred to as &amp;ldquo;Anbiping&amp;rdquo;) aims to integrate the strengths of both parties, focusing on the intelligent development of pathology diagnosis. This includes the integration and enhancement of multimodal medical data, medical image data annotation and processing based on crowdsourcing and knowledge graphs, as well as data-centric explainable medical artificial intelligence and other related cutting-edge topics. The goal is to enhance pathology diagnosis services and the value of medical data, promoting high-quality development in the pathology industry.&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;This collaborative project officially launched in May 2023. The research projects conducted by the laboratory include crowdsourcing annotation of medical data, weakly supervised learning for medical AI tasks, and research on the explainability of medical AI tasks.&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img class=&#34;col-img&#34; src=&#34;//localhost:1313/collaborate/LBP_MDI_establish.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;Currently, we have built an automatic annotation platform that can accurately label pathology images such as immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Pathologists using this platform have provided feedback indicating a 50% reduction in annotation time. We have also developed a large language model with pathology knowledge, which demonstrates good diagnostic abilities for given pathology images. We will continue to optimize existing data models, aiming to reach the level of junior pathology doctors in image interpretation and diagnosis. Additionally, we are conducting data mining on stored pathology images and unstructured pathology data such as text descriptions, providing a solid data foundation for pathology research.&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img class=&#34;col-img&#34; src=&#34;//localhost:1313/collaborate/LBP_data_mining.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;Pathology is the &amp;ldquo;gold standard&amp;rdquo; for tumor diagnosis, and cancer prevention and control rely heavily on pathology diagnosis. As pathology diagnosis transitions towards digitization and intelligence, the standardization and efficient annotation of pathology data have become critical challenges in the transformation process. Anbiping is the first listed company in the domestic pathology diagnosis field, specializing in the research and development of pathology diagnosis-related technical products. Their cervical liquid-based cytology image-assisted diagnosis software (LBP-PIAS) has achieved technological breakthroughs in medical image analysis and clinical diagnostic assistance. In this context, Professor Chen Lei, the head of the laboratory, pointed out that in the current field of machine learning, models and hardware resources are relatively abundant, while high-quality data resources are extremely scarce. He hopes that through collaboration with Anbiping, the shift from a &amp;ldquo;model-centric&amp;rdquo; approach to a &amp;ldquo;data-centric&amp;rdquo; approach can be achieved. By breaking down complex medical tasks into simpler tasks that junior medical workers can handle, the cost of data acquisition can be reduced. Utilizing a large amount of automatically annotated simple task data to improve AI diagnostic accuracy, fully tapping into the potential value of pathology data. By quantifying medical indicators, extracting diagnostic rules, providing data-based explainability, addressing the pain points in the intelligent pathology diagnosis process, and contributing to the intelligent pathology diagnosis in China and even worldwide, benefiting society through precise medical diagnosis.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;col-img&#34; src=&#34;//localhost:1313/collaborate/xh_col.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;Colposcopy is a technique used to screen and diagnose abnormalities in the cervix, vagina, and other areas in women. The interpretation of colposcopy reports often includes specialized terminology and complex medical data, which can be difficult for the average patient to understand. Additionally, doctors face the challenge of improving diagnostic and communication efficiency. Our collaboration with Peking Union Medical College and Shenzhen Maternity &amp;amp; Child Healthcare Hospital aims to address this issue by developing an intelligent interpretation system. This system will enable patients to easily understand their reports and gain a deeper understanding of their health status. At the same time, it will provide doctors with technical support and personalized diagnostic recommendations based on the reports, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and service quality, and improving communication efficiency between doctors and patients.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;This project aims to develop and validate a multimodal AI model for predicting the efficacy of various drug therapies in treating Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) symptoms. GER symptoms arise from the abnormal reflux of stomach and duodenal contents into the esophagus, causing esophageal and extra-esophageal symptoms or complications. Based on the Rome IV criteria, GER symptom patients are categorized into GERD (including erosive esophagitis and non-erosive reflux disease, NERD) and functional esophageal disorders (such as reflux hypersensitivity, RH, and functional heartburn, FH). Given the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms among these subtypes, current treatments like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often suboptimal, with up to 50% of patients showing partial or no response. This project integrates multidimensional data including patient clinical information, endoscopic images, high-resolution esophageal manometry, and dynamic pH-impedance monitoring to build an AI model that accurately predicts the efficacy of various treatment regimens for GER symptoms, providing personalized medication guidance for clinicians.&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- &lt;div&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/product_files/Non-pathological_Image_Filtering.png&#34; alt=&#34;Project 1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt; --&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;Hebei Medical University Fourth Hospital and the Joint Intelligent Medical Data Experiment Center of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) officially launched a joint research project in September 2024 to establish a multi-modal deep learning model based on HE images and HER2 immunohistochemistry images for predicting the prognosis of metastatic breast cancer. This project integrates multi-modal data and applies deep learning technology to provide a more accurate and efficient method for breast cancer prognosis prediction, demonstrating significant clinical value and advancing the integration of artificial intelligence with medicine.&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;col-text&#34;&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women globally, and HER2 is an important prognostic and predictive indicator for primary and metastatic breast cancer. Recently, novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown significant therapeutic effects in patients with late-stage HER2-low breast cancer, expanding treatment options beyond HER2-positive patients. However, HER2 expression in breast cancer exhibits spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and the discordance in HER2 expression between primary and metastatic lesions affects the efficacy and prognosis of patients receiving novel ADCs treatment. Accurate prognosis prediction for these patients is crucial for individualized treatment. Traditional prognosis prediction relies on clinical and pathological features, but these methods have limitations in accuracy and flexibility. The collaborative laboratory adopts a multi-modal deep learning approach, combining information from HE images and HER2 immunohistochemistry images to enhance the accuracy of predicting the prognosis of metastatic breast cancer. The core advantage of multi-modal deep learning models lies in their ability to integrate different types of data, automatically learn and extract key features from each modality, thus generating predictions with greater clinical relevance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
